# Disclaimer and Indemnification

By downloading, installing, and using the Party Bots application, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

1. No Liability: The developer of Party Bots, including any affiliates or associates, is not liable for any financial losses, damages, or negative outcomes resulting from your use of this application. The app is provided "as-is," and you use it entirely at your own risk. The developer is not responsible for any decisions you make based on the output or behavior of the application.

2. Indemnification: By using Party Bots, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the developer and any affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses arising from your use of the application. You understand that you cannot hold the developer liable for any actions taken by the app, including but not limited to financial losses, trading errors, or failed transactions.

3. Personal Responsibility: You acknowledge that the use of Party Bots is entirely at your own discretion and risk. You take full responsibility for any financial or other outcomes arising from using this app. The developer makes no guarantees regarding profitability or success.

4. Demo Mode Encouragement: You are strongly encouraged to use the app in demo mode for an extended period before investing any real money. Demo mode allows you to familiarize yourself with the application, its behavior, and its limitations without incurring financial risk. The decision to transition from demo mode to live trading is entirely your own, and you accept all risks involved.

5. No Investment Advice: Party Bots does not provide investment advice or recommendations. The choice of currencies, amounts to invest, and other parameters are your own decisions. The developer has shown that it is possible to earn approximately $1 per hour by investing $50 per bot for 2 bots per currency across 20 reasonably volatile currencies; however, past performance is not indicative of future results, and this example is not a guarantee of similar outcomes.

6. Assumption of Risk: Trading cryptocurrencies involves significant risk, and you may lose all or part of your invested capital. The use of Party Bots to automate trading does not eliminate this risk. By using the app, you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with trading and automation.

## Important
By proceeding with the use of Party Bots, you accept all of the above terms, disclaimers, and conditions. You agree that you cannot sue or hold the developer liable for any financial outcomes, losses, or damages.

Thank you for understanding and using Party Bots responsibly.
